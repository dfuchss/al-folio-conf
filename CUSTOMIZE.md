# Customize

Here we will give you some tips on how to customize the website. One important thing to note is that **ALL** the changes you make should be done on the **main** branch of your repository. The `gh-pages` branch is automatically overwritten every time you make a change to the main branch.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows, focusing on the main components that you will need to modify:

```txt
.
├── 📂 assets/: contains the assets that are displayed in the website
├── 📄 _config.yml: the configuration file of the template
├── 📂 _data/: contains some of the data used in the template
│   └── 📄 socials.yml: your social media and contact info in YAML format
├── 📂 _includes/: contains code parts that are included in the main HTML file
├── 📂 _layouts/: contains the layouts to choose from in the frontmatter of the Markdown files
├── 📂 _pages/: contains the pages of the website
|   └── 📄 404.md: 404 page (page not found)
└── 📂 _sass/: contains the SASS files that define the style of the website
    ├── 📄 _base.scss: base style of the website
    ├── 📄 _cv.scss: style of the CV page
    ├── 📄 _distill.scss: style of the Distill articles
    ├── 📄 _layout.scss: style of the overall layout
    ├── 📄 _themes.scss: themes colors and a few icons
    └── 📄 _variables.scss: variables used in the SASS files
```

## Configuration

The configuration file [\_config.yml](_config.yml) contains the main configuration of the website. Most of the settings is self-explanatory and we also tried to add as much comments as possible. If you have any questions, please check if it was not already answered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/FAQ.md).

> Note that the `url` and `baseurl` settings are used to generate the links of the website, as explained in the [install instructions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

All changes made to this file are only visible after you rebuild the website. That means that you need to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` again if you are running the website locally or push your changes to GitHub if you are using GitHub Pages. All other changes are visible immediately, you only need to refresh the page.

## Creating new pages

You can create new pages by adding new Markdown files in the [\_pages](_pages/) directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing page and modify it. You can choose the layout of the page by changing the [layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) attribute in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the Markdown file, and also the path to access it by changing the [permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) attribute. You can also add new layouts in the [\_layouts](_layouts/) directory if you feel the need for it.
